# Linear-Discriminant-Analysis-based-Voice-Disease-Recognition

Disease diagnosis in medical healthcare leveraging machine learning
is an area of significant interest in the whole world. Audio data analysis has facilitated the route of identifying voice disorders in a non-invasive manner. As
vocal cord malady can immerse anytime from various bad habits (loud sound,
smoking, extra force on vocal cords, etc.) and neurological imbalance, early
recognition of voice disorders can save people from causing long-term damage.
In this research, the three most injurious voice diseases have been recognized
exploiting the LDA based MFCC feature matrix and KNN algorithm. Our empirical study has successfully predicted four voice class labels using this scheme
with the foremost 96.49% accuracy and surpassed five other mining algorithms
including Artificial Neural Network. Moreover, this model can generate output
within 22.37 milliseconds which is also the lowest execution time compared to
the traditional clustering methods. Our proposed model can be easily implemented to design end-to-end service for efficient voice disease classification.
